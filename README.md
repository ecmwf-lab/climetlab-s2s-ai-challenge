# S2S AI challenge Datasets

Sub seasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Artificial Intelligence Challenge : https://s2s-ai-challenge.github.io/

In this README is a description of how to get the data for the S2S AI challenge. Here is a more general [description of the S2S data](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/S2S/Description). The data used for the S2S AI challenge is a subset of this S2S data.

There are several ways to use the datasets. Either by direct download (wget, curl, browser) for GRIB and NetCDF formats ; or using the climetlab python package with this addon, for GRIB and NetCDF and zarr formats. Zarr is a cloud-friendly experimental data format and supports dowloading only the part of the data that is required. It has been designed to work better than classical format on a cloud environment (experimental).

## Datasets description

There are four datasets provided for this challenge. As we are aiming at bringing together the two communities of Machine Learning and Weather Prediction, they have been aliases to use both two points of views :

| ML                          | NWP                          |                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `training-input`            | `hindcast-input`             | Training  dataset (input for training the ML models)   |
| `training-output-reference` | `hindcast-like-observations` | Training dataset (output for training the ML models)   |
| `test-input`                | `forecast-input`             | Test dataset (DO NOT use for training)                 |
| `test-output-reference`     | `forecast-like-observations` | Test dataset (DO NOT use at all)                       |
| `test-output-benchmark`     | `forecast-benchmark`         | Benchmark output (on the test dataset) (NOT AVAILABLE) |

**Overfitting** is always an potential issue when using ML algorithms. To address this, the data is usually split into three datasets : 
[training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Training_dataset), 
[validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Validation_dataset) 
and [test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Test_dataset). 
This terminology has lead to [some confusion in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Confusion_in_terminology). 
Splitting the `hindcast-input` (`training-input`) dataset between training and validation is standard way and should be decided carefully.

The `forecast-input` (`test-input`) must not be used as a validation dataset  : it must not be used to tune the hyperparameters or make decision about the ML model. 
Fostering discussions about how to prevent overfitting may be an outcome of the challenge.

### Hindcast input (Training input)

The `hindcast-input`(`training-input`) dataset consists in data from three different models : ECMWF (ecmf), ECCC (cwao), NCEP (kwbc).
These data are hindcast data. This is used as the input for training the ML models.
This dataset is available as grib, netcdf or zarr.
In this dataset, the data is available from 1998 for the oldest, to 2019/12/31 for the most recent. <!-- whats available from 1998? -->
  - ECMWF hindcast data
    - forecast_time : from 2000/01/01 to 2019/12/31, weekly every 7 days (every Thurday).
    - lead_time : 0 to 46 days
    - valid_time (forecast_time + lead_time): from 2000/01/01 to 2019/12/31
  - ECCC hindcast data 
    - forecast_time : from , weekly every 7 days (every Thurday).
    - lead_time : 1 to 32 days
    - valid_time (forecast_time + lead_time): from 
    - variables sm20, sm100, st20, st100 not available
  - NCEP hindcast data 
    - forecast_time : from 1999/01/07 to 2010/12/30, weekly every 7 days (every Thurday).
    - lead_time : 1 to 44 days
    - valid_time (forecast_time + lead_time): from 1999/01/07 to 2011/02/11
    - variable "rsn" not available.

  zarr

### Forecast input (Test input)
The `forecast-input` (`test-input`) dataset consists also in data from three different models : ECMWF (ecmf), ECCC (cwao), NCEP (eccc), for different dates.
These data are forecast data.
This could be used the input for applying the ML models in order to generate the output which is submitted for the challenge.
Using data from earlier date that 2020/01/01 is also allowed during the prediction phase.
The forecast start dates in this dataset are from 2020/01/02 to 2020/12/31.
  - For all 3 models : 
    - forecast_time : from 2020/01/02 to 2020/12/31, weekly every 7 days (every Thurday).
    - valid_time (forecast_time + lead_time): from 2020/01/02 to 2020/12/31 <!-- valid_time extends into 2021 -->
  - ECMWF forecast
    - lead_time : 0 to 46 days
  - ECCC forecast 
    - lead_time : 1 to 32 days
    - variables sm20, sm100, st20, st100 not available
  - NCEP forecast 
    - lead_time : 1 to 44 days
    - variable "rsn" not available.


 List of files :
  [grib](https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/grib/index.html),
  [netcdf](https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/netcdf/index.html),
  zarr
  
### Observations 
The `hindcast-like-observations` (`training-output-reference`) dataset.
The `forecast-like-observations` (`test-output-reference`) dataset.

The observations are the ground truth to compare with the ML model output and evaluate them. It consists in observation from instruments of temperature and accumulated total precipitation. (TODO add more descriptions) (point to the scripts to create them ? TODO).


Generally speaking, only past data can be used by the ML models to perform their forecast :

__Rule 1 : Observed data beyond the forecast date should not be used for prediction, for instance a forecast starting on 2020/07/01 should not use observed data beyond 2020/07/01).__

Dates in the observation dataset are from 2000/01/01 to 2021/02/20. (TODO check dates)

The `observations` dataset have been build from real instrument observations.

- The `hindcast-like-observations` (`training-output-reference`) dataset :
 - Available from 2000/01/01 to 2019/12/31, weekly every 7 days (every Thurday)
 - Observation data before 2019/12/31 can be used for training (as the truth to evaluate and optimize the ML models or tweak hyper parameters using train/valid split or cross-validation).
- The `forecast-like-observations` (`test-output-reference`) dataset.
 - Available from2020/01/01 to 2021/02/20 , weekly every 7 days (every Thurday)
 - The test data must **not** be used during training. In theory, these data should not be disclosed during the challenge, but the nature of the data make is possible to access it from other sources. That is the reason why the code used for training model must be submitted along with the prediction (as a jupyter notebook) and the top ranked proposition will be reviewed by the organizing board. 

![train_validation_split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8441217/114999589-e5f29f80-9e99-11eb-90e3-8a4a3e9545d5.png)

During forecast phase (i.e. the evaluation phase using the forecast-input dataset), 2020 observation data is used. Rule 1 still stands : Observed data beyond the forecast start date should not be used for prediction.

### Forecast Benchmark (Test output benchmark) (Not yet available)
The `forecast-benchmark` (`test-output-benchmark`) dataset is an example of output of a ML model to be submitted.

The "ML model" used to produce this dataset is TODO.
It consists in applying to the `forecast-input' a simple re-calibration of from the mean of the hindcast (training) data.
  - forecast_time : from 2020/01/01 to 2020/12/31, weekly every 7 days (every Thurday).
  - lead_time : two values : 28 days and 35 days (To be discussed)
  - valid_time (forecast_time + lead_time): from 2020/01/01 to 2020/12/31 <!-- valid_time extends into 2021 -->


## Data download (GRIB or NetCDF)

The list of GRIB and files for the 'training-input' dataset can be found at : 

 List of files GRIB files :[https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/grib/index.html](https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/grib/index.html),
 
 List of files NetCDF files : [https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/grib/index.html](https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/test-input/0.3.0/netcdf/index.html),
  
For input datasets,  the pattern is https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/{datasetname}/0.3.0/{format}/{origin}-{fctype}-{parameter}-YYYYMMDD.grib

For observations datasets, the pattern is https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/{datasetname}/{parameter}/{frequency}-since-2000/YYYYMMDD.nc

The URLs are constructed according to the following pattern: 

- {datasetname} : training-input. In the URLs the dataset name must follow the ML naming (training-input, test-input)
- {origin} : ecmwf or eccc or ncep.
- {fctype} : hindcast (training dataset and forecast for test dataset). <!-- no needed anymore, is it? -->
- {parameter} is "t2m" for surface temperature at 2m, "tp" for total precipitation using CF convention. <!-- rather ECWMF convention, maybe link https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/S2S/Parameters -->
- YYYYMMDD is the date of main forecast time in the file.
- frequency is "weekly" ("daily" for test dataset) <!-- no needed anymore, is it? -->
<!-- format: only allowed for training data, netcdf, grib or zarr, observations come as netcdf -->

Example to retrieve the file with wget :

``` wget https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/training-input/0.3.0/grib/ncep-hindcast-q-20101014.grib ``` (132.8M )

### Zarr format (experimental).
 
The zarr storage location include all the reference data. The zarr urls are **not** designed to be open in a browser (see [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable)):
While accessing the zarr storage without climetlab may be possible, we recommend using climetlab with the appropriate plugin (climetlab-s2s-ai-challenge)

Zarr urls are :
  -  `training-input` https://storage.ecmwf.europeanweather.cloud/s2s-ai-challenge/data/training-input/{origin}/0.1.43/zarr/ (TODO not yet available)
  -  `training-output-reference` : not available.
  -  `forecast-benchmark` : not available.
